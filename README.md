## Team (Intro)

### Alexever17

Team lead, Frontend Dev.<br>
A business university student who just loves web development and declared it to his favorite hobby. I am mostly a front end developer who also has one small project with some backend. You can see my portfolio here: [Portfolio](https://malakhov.work)

### Soreg
Advisor, Frontend Dev<br>
A passionate developer who loves to collaborate on new projects. I am a _mostly_ self-taught developer who loves to keep up to date with new trends and technologies. I am currently working at [HeseHus](https://www.hesehus.com/) in Denmark as a frontend developer. With this project, I hope to further improve mine + my teammates' skills in React and Redux. My personal portfolio can be found [here](http://sorendev-sidescroll-test.herokuapp.com/).

### FancyAction

Full Stack Dev<br>
Friend to all corgis and a few humans. I'm a self-taught web dev with a background in communications (and some hobby projects built with C#/Unity). With this project, I am attempting to transition from frontend to backend in pursuit of going fullstack. As a result, I'll be working on whatever issues are needed with a focus on backend. You can see some of my previous projects [here](http://Allistair.net).
