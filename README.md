## Team (Intro)

### Alexever17

Team lead, Frontend Dev.<br>
A business university student who just loves web development and declared it to his favorite hobby. I am mostly a front end developer who also has one small project with some backend. You can see my portfolio here: [Portfolio](https://malakhov.work)

### Soreg

Advisor, Frontend Dev<br>
A passionate developer who loves to collaborate on new projects. I am a _mostly_ self-taught developer who loves to keep up to date with new trends and technologies. I am currently working at [HeseHus](https://www.hesehus.com/) in Denmark as a frontend developer. With this project, I hope to further improve mine + my teammates' skills in React and Redux. My personal portfolio can be found [here](http://sorendev-sidescroll-test.herokuapp.com/).

### FancyAction

Full Stack Dev<br>
Friend to all corgis and a few humans. I'm a self-taught web dev with a background in communications (and some hobby projects built with C#/Unity). With this project, I am attempting to transition from frontend to backend in pursuit of going fullstack. As a result, I'll be working on whatever issues are needed with a focus on backend. You can see some of my previous projects [here](http://Allistair.net).

### Jethro Fredericks

Full-stack developer-in-training<br>
I'm a self-taught web developer that loves all things code and hates all things design. I've dabbled in a number to languages but I've settled into using JavaScript over the past 6 or so months, having learned and created projects using React, Node.js and Express.js. My primary focus for this project will be working on the back-end and learning how to optimise MongoDB requests to minimise response times, but given my experience with React and Redux, I will probably spend my fair share of time contributing towards the front-end as well. My portfolio exists in a far-off place called "The Future", so if you'd like to see it I would suggest you hop in a time machine.

### Nari Roh

Full-stack Developer <br>
"Travelling & Coding" these are two things I love and what I spend most time on. Recently I live in Mexico city enjoying delicious tacos and learning & building things with my passion. I focus on deepening my JavaScript knowledge now by learning JavaScript frameworks & libraries. With this project, I aim to learn more about MERN stack and have experince building an actual app with it. 

### jmaldia

Frontend Dev <br>
I am an entrepreneur by heart but I also enjoy building things. I am currently working with a startup as a consultant. Aside from this project, I am also involved in another project focused on healthy lifestyle living. You can learn more about me and my work [here](http://jonmaldia.com).

### NatalieR

Frontend Developer <br>
My background is in psych & marketing and I’ve spent the last several years  working in market research (and still consult for my former employer).  I’ve always loved to build and create, however, and decided to make the jump to web development earlier this year.  I’m interested in focusing on the front end, because I love all things design - the aesthetics and the user experience aspect - but plan to learn back-end down the line.  I am looking forward to learning React with this project.
